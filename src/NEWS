04-SEP-2011: Torrus release 2.01

In this release:

-- New release numbering scheme. Torrus releases are two-number, and
   compatible plugins have 3-number versions.

-- New discovery modules: CiscoWLC, C-COM CAPSPAN, Thomson_xDSL, Actelis,
   NexComm, Patton

-- New MIBs supported: CISCO-WAN-3G-MIB

-- New IF-MIB selector action: AddTemplates

-- "rrgraph-view" parameter can be used in tokensets to define the
   default graph presentation. It can also be set by XXX-tokenset-rrgraph-view
   in DevDiscover input file.

-- RFC2662_ADSL_LINE discovery module is now compatible with Cisco 837

-- Port QoS stats for Cisco ME3400

-- ifDescr and ifName uniqueness is checked before using them as
   interface identifiers. This eases the use of new devices with their
   special interface naming.

-- WebUI now uses NodeID whenever it is available instead of tokens, and
   full node paths if NodeID is unavailable.

-- MicrosoftWindows discovery module is improved and lots of unneeded
   IF-MIB interfaces are eliminated.

-- New feature: SNMP reachability statistics for devices.

-- FastCGI handler is automatically re-spawning every 5000 requests.

-- Device uptime is no longer displayed in the graph legend.

-- Exclusive collector initialization lock is added for servers with
   multiple collector processes. This reduces the disk seek concurrency
   at collector startup.

-- Default rrd-create-heartbeat changed	from 500 to 720

-- Reduced the possibility for NaN values in RRD files at collector
   re-initialization

-- Integration into external portals: Web RPC, embedded graph view, PDF
   and SVG formats for the graphs

-- New plugin: tp-siam for SIAM library integration. It enables to build
   customer portals with the use of Extopus software and an external
   service inventory. See docs/nodeid_usage.pod for more details.


   
24-OCT-2010: Torrus release 1.0.9

It is recommended to re-run discovery and compilation immediately after
upgrading from 1.0.8.

In this release:

-- WebUI handling is re-designed. FastCGI is supported with Apache
   and Lighttpd. User authorization option has changed its name:
   "$Torrus::CGI::authorizeUsers". Login page has now "remember me" checkbox.
   Apache configuration statements for mod_perl have slightly changed.
   Removed dependency: libapreq2 is no longer needed.

-- New Perl module required by installer: JSON

-- New discovery modules: Force10, NetBotz, Arista, ALU_Timetra, Foundry,
   CasaCMTS, Jacarta.

-- Support for semi-transparent lines and areas in multigraphs.

-- Support for arbitrary names for subtrees and leaves (node-display-name
   parameter). Now original interface names are displayed, without underscores.

-- Monitor alarms are now preserved between config re-compilations. Also
   dynamic tokenset members are preserved. A new utility:
   "torrus flushmonitors" flushes old alarms.

-- New parameter: nodeid. It is designed for easier integration of Torrus with
   other OSS systems. See the "NodeID usage guidelines" document for more
   details.

-- Current SNMP failures are recorded in a database and displayed by
   "torrus snmpfailures" utility. The output is in JSON format, so it's easy
   to integrate into other alerting systems.

-- RHEL compatibility: the old Init script did not stop the daemons properly
   upon a system reboot.

-- Compatibility with the newest version of Net::SNMP module.

-- Host-based authentication: remote systems, such as customer self-care
   portals, can retrieve graphs from Torrus WebUI.

-- Performance optimizations: XML compiler runs 10-15% faster.

-- Custom CSS styles must no longer reside in Torrus installation directory.




26-APR-2010: Torrus release 1.0.8bf01

Bugfix release. No new features or functionality.

05-APR-2009: Torrus release 1.0.8

Note: a complete re-compile of the XML is required after upgrading.

In this release:

-- BerkeleyDB stability has significantly improved due to new signal handlers.

-- View parameters can be overridden with URL variables "Gstart",
   "Gend" and so on.

-- Collector initialization time is improved by shifting some work
   to the XML compiler.

-- New command-line utility: srvderive. It combines several serviceIDs into
   a single report by calculating their sum or maximum value
   (sponsored by nexellent ag, www.nexellent.ch)

-- A number of bugfixes and minor imprvements.

-- Added SNMP discovery support for Arbor E series and Liebert HVAC


05-AUG-2008: Torrus release 1.0.7

In this release:

-- Added and improved vendor support for Symmetricom, Juniper JunOS,
   Cisco SCE, 

-- New discovery parameters, selectors and selector actions.

-- Default value for "collector-timeoffset-step" increased from 30 to 60
   seconds. 30 seconds is too short for many installations.

-- Support for PostgreSQL in reports generator.

-- Support for IPv6 in SNMP discovery and collector.

-- New collector plugin: "tp-rawexport" for plaintext export of collector data.

-- Cisco QoS monitoring plugin "tp-cisco-cbqos" upgraded to version 1.6.
   It fixes an old bug in RRD file naming, thus all the QoS-related RRD files
   would have to be renamed or started from scratch.

-- Other minor enhancements and bugfixes (see ChangeLog for details).


03-AUG-2007: Torrus release 1.0.6

In this release:

-- All the trees need to be recompiled after Torrus upgrade.

-- Search capability. The nodes can be searched within a tree or globally.
   The search database needs to be updated with "torrus buildsearchdb"
   utility.

-- GUI improvements. Recursive view is restricted and is not offered
   averywhere. Bugfix for Mozilla browser compatibility: now the graph
   images are clickable.

-- devdiscover accepts multiple DDX files. Combined with multithreading,
   this improves the discovery performance even further.

-- SNMP collector periodically refreshes the table mappings. This helps
   for modular routers with online insertion and removal: the collector
   does not need to be restarted after the physical configuration changes.
   Also the OIDs that return noSuchObject are excluded from polling
   immediately.

-- New MIBs support: Cisco SCE per-service traffic statistics; Cisco CAR
   statistics; Cisco Ethernet MAC accounting statistics now available on
   subinterfaces; JunOS per-CoS stats; support for Alteon hardware.

-- <filepattern> XML statement is no longer supported. Use the rrddir2xml
   utility instead.

-- The CDEF collector from Chrstian Schnidrig is integrated in the main
   distribution. Devdiscover supports traffic summaries for multiple
   interfaces.

-- The report generator can generate HTML in any tree. Earlier it was
   generating the reports only for the trees where data was collected.
   This improvement allows to split the collecting and viewing trees.

-- The installer allows multithreading for Perl version 5.8.8 or higher only.
   Earlier versions are known for memory leaks in multithreaded operation.

-- Multiple collector instances per tree. This improves the CPU utilization
   for multi-CPU servers. See the torrus_collector manpage.



25-JAN-2007: Torrus release 1.0.5

This is a major release with many new features.

In this release:

-- Bugfixes in SNMPv3 support

-- Perl multithreading. If threads are supported by local Perl,
   Devdiscover can perform parallel discoveries per output file.
   Also the Collector runs a background thread for RRD updates.

-- Improvement in SNMP collector initialization. Now the collector expands
   the interface names and other maps asynchronously, which dramatically
   reduces the initialization time for large installations.
   Cisco QoS plugin needs an upgrade to version 1.4 or higher.

-- New vendor support in SNMP discovery engine:
   Motorola BSR CMTS (ex-Riverdelta), Cisco SCE, BGP prefix statistics for
   Cisco IOS routers, Cisco IOS XR support.

-- DOCSIS upstream statistics have changed the format, therefore
   the old stats will be lost after upgrade. The stats now include the
   US Frequency graphs.

-- Interface statistics now contain "All Errors" tab with all error graphs
   in one page.

-- Interface traffic graphs may contain bandwidth utilization percentage
   information (see RFC2863_IF_MIB::bandwidth-usage in SNMP Discovery
   Guide).

-- Cisco MAC accounting can also be used for billing reports.


20-JUL-2006: Torrus release 1.0.4

This is a major release with many new features.

In this release:

-- SNMP Version 3 support in Devdiscover and SNMP collector.

-- Usage reports for billing. Including 95% percentile reports.
   More details at http://torrus.org/reporting_setup.pod.html

-- Various improvements in SNMP discovery engine and new equipment
   vendor support

-- Improved monitor notifications. New parameter: "severity"
   and new action "action_notify".

-- New torrus-siteconfig.pl variables to improve WebUI customization



02-AUG-2005: Torrus release 1.0.3

This is a minor bugfix release. Unreachable device handling is improved, and
also there's a possibility to specify extra Perl library path in ./configure


27-JUL-2005: Torrus release 1.0.2

The new release requires one additional Perl module to be
installed: Date::Parse. You can install it from CPAN by using the command:
  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Parse'

In this release:

-- Unreachable SNMP devices handling has significantly improved.
   The default unreachable timeout is set to 6 hours.

-- Support for the new mod_perl 2.0 layout.

-- New OID in TORRUS-MIB: torrusMonitorDesc, for easier processing of
   SNMP traps.

-- ./configure checks if the user "torrus" exists in the system

-- New SNMP discovery parameters:
   RFC2863_IF_MIB::only-interfaces
   disable-snmpcollector

-- On the graph page, it is now possible to choose the date for displaying
   old statistics.

-- The Cisco CPUs are now managed by devdiscover's selectors.
   This allows you to add monitors to specific CPU graphs, and also add them
   to a tokenset.


21-JUN-2005: Torrus release 1.0.1

In this release:

-- SNMP errors are now handled better. See the User guide for more details.

-- New command line option for monitor: --delay. The init script
   launches the monitor with 20 minutes delay, to allow the collector
   update RRD files before monitoring them.

-- New devdiscover option: --fallback. It is useful in large production
   environments when it's important to have a device in the web interface
   even if it's turned off

-- Cisco DOCSIS templates now include Total, Active, and Registered
   modem quantities. RRD file structure has changed, so the graphs will
   start anew.

-- The meaning of $Torrus::Renderer::stylingProfileOverlay
   has changed: now it refers to a file name.


10-JUN-2005: Torrus release 1.0.0

In this release, compared to RRFW release 0.1.8:

-- New directory structure, with local configuration completely separated
   from the distribution files

-- Comand-line wrapper "torrus" for executing all commands, with short aliases
   ("dd" for "devdiscover" etc.)

-- Plugins may be easily added to existing installation

-- Relative file names in DDX files searched in the right directories

-- Discovery object selectors: the new way to customize the discovery results

-- New discovery modules:
   AxxessIT.pm: Cisco ONS 15300 SDH switches
   CiscoIOS_Docsis.pm: Cisco IOS DOCSIS specifics: upstream utilization and
     modem quantities
   BetterNetworks.pm: BetterNetworks EthernetBox sensors (temperature, humidity
     and so on)
   CiscoIOS_MacAccounting.pm: Automated discovery for Cisco MAC accounting.
     If applicable, MAC peers are associated with BGP peers.

-- Discovery modules improvements:
     IF-MIB indexing hints for unknown devices
     Docsis downstream utilization
     Selector actions for IF-MIB, Docsis, and temperature sensor objects
     Line cards and modules memory stats for modular Ciscso routers     

-- Improved performance of monitor daemon

-- extended example of DOCSIS monitors and 3-level alarms in
   xmlconfig/examples/docsis-monitors.xml

-- Renderer module improved for multi-CPU servers

-- Web interface improvements:
     Recursive directory view,
     Monitor names and comments diaplayed,
     Sizes of tokensets displayed
     Multiple overviews possible for a subtree

-- SO_RCVBUF is set explicitly in SNMP collector to sustain bursts of traffic

-- RRD files automatically moved in case of conflicts

-- ttproclist: the new utility for automating the DDX files generation

-- action_snmptrap now sends an optional severity parameter

-- New option for devdiscover: --forcebundle to write the bundle file
   even if errors occur

-- The init script is configurable by a separate configuration file.
   It also launches the monitors with 20 minutes delay if monitors
   are launched together with collectors
